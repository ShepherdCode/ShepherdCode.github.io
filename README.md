## Welcome to Shepherd Code

Welcome to the programming sandbox that belongs to computer science students and faculty at [Shepherd University](https://www.shepherd.edu) in Shepherdstown WV USA. Shepherd Code is a GitHub educational organization with source code repositiories stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/ShepherdCode). 

Most of our repos are private and we use them to teach and learn programming language concepts. For example, we generate HTML pages like [this](test.html) using GitHub Pages to serve HTML.
